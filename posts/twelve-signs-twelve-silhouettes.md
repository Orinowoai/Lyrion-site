# Twelve Signs, Twelve Silhouettes

Stand in a room of twelve strangers, each born under a different zodiac sign, and even before they speak, you'll sense the variations. Not just in what they wear, but in *how* they wear it. The way a Leo carries gold versus how a Virgo does. The drape a Pisces prefers versus the structure a Capricorn demands.

This isn't stereotype. It's frequency.

## The Fire Signs: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius

**Silhouette:** Bold lines. Confident angles. Nothing apologetic.

Fire signs dress like they're about to walk into a room and change it. Aries favors athletic-luxe: hoodies that suggest motion even at rest, caps tilted just so, the first to try the unexpected color. Leo wants drama — metallics that catch light, statement pieces that command attention without begging for it. Sagittarius blends adventure with elegance: joggers elevated to art, scarves that have clearly traveled, nothing too precious to live in.

**The LYRĪON approach:** We give fire signs clothing that honors their heat without burning them out. Breathable fabrics. Colors that pop without screaming. Affirmations woven into hems: *I move like light through form.*

## The Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn

**Silhouette:** Tailored. Textured. Built to last.

Earth signs understand that luxury is felt, not just seen. Taurus wants softness — velvet that begs to be touched, organic cotton that breathes like skin. Virgo demands precision: seams that align perfectly, details that reveal themselves slowly, quality that whispers rather than shouts. Capricorn chooses investment pieces: the hoodie you wear for a decade, the beanie that becomes part of your silhouette, classics that appreciate over time.

**The LYRĪON approach:** We obsess over hand-feel. Every earth-sign piece is tested for durability and comfort. Our beanies have reinforced stitching. Our hoodies use double-layer fleece. These aren't trends; they're heirlooms in training.

## The Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius

**Silhouette:** Layered. Light. Open to interpretation.

Air signs dress in conversation — with themselves, with others, with ideas. Gemini loves reversibility: the hoodie that works two ways, the scarf that transforms. Libra seeks aesthetic balance: colors that harmonize, proportions that please, beauty as a moral imperative. Aquarius pioneers: the first to wear the unexpected combination, the visionary in practical form.

**The LYRĪON approach:** We design for versatility. Our scarves work as wraps, belts, or wall art. Our tees layer under hoodies or stand alone. Air signs get bored; we keep them interested with subtle complexity — geometric patterns that reveal themselves over time, dual-tone designs, pieces that spark ideas.

## The Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces

**Silhouette:** Flowing. Mysterious. Emotionally resonant.

Water signs dress from feeling. Cancer wants comfort that nurtures: soft hoodies like embraces, moon-phase prints that track internal tides. Scorpio chooses intensity: deep colors, transformative pieces, clothing that holds secrets (our chains have affirmations engraved on the *inside*). Pisces flows: scarves that move like water, fabrics that adapt to mood, nothing too rigid or defined.

**The LYRĪON approach:** We honor emotional intelligence. Our water-sign pieces use natural dyes that deepen over time, prints that shift in different lights, materials that respond to body heat. We don't just make clothes; we make wearable empathy.

## Beyond Sun Signs: The Complete Chart

Your sun sign is your headline, but your rising sign is your outfit. Your moon sign is what you wear at home when no one's watching. Your Venus placement determines what you find beautiful. Your Mars placement shows how you *move* in your clothes.

A Virgo sun with Leo rising? They'll want that precision *and* that gold. A Capricorn sun with Pisces moon? Structure on the outside, softness within — literally, the cashmere-lined leather jacket of the zodiac.

## Style as Self-Knowledge

The ancient Greeks inscribed *"Know thyself"* at Delphi. We'd add: *"Dress thyself accordingly."*

When you understand your elemental composition — how much fire, earth, air, and water you carry — you can build a wardrobe that supports rather than suppresses. You stop buying what you "should" wear and start choosing what makes you feel like the most potent version of yourself.

## The Question

Do your clothes make you feel more you, or more like who you think you should be?

There's a difference. And the stars know it.
